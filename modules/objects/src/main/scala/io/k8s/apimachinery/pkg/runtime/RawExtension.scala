/** RawExtension is used to hold extensions in external versions.
  *
  * To use this, make a field which has RawExtension as its type in your
  * external, versioned struct, and Object in your internal struct. You also
  * need to register your various plugin types.
  *
  * // Internal package:
  *
  * type MyAPIObject struct { runtime.TypeMeta `json:",inline"` MyPlugin
  * runtime.Object `json:"myPlugin"` }
  *
  * type PluginA struct { AOption string `json:"aOption"` }
  *
  * // External package:
  *
  * type MyAPIObject struct { runtime.TypeMeta `json:",inline"` MyPlugin
  * runtime.RawExtension `json:"myPlugin"` }
  *
  * type PluginA struct { AOption string `json:"aOption"` }
  *
  * // On the wire, the JSON will look something like this:
  *
  * { "kind":"MyAPIObject", "apiVersion":"v1", "myPlugin": { "kind":"PluginA",
  * "aOption":"foo", }, }
  *
  * So what happens? Decode first uses json or yaml to unmarshal the serialized
  * data into your external MyAPIObject. That causes the raw JSON to be stored,
  * but not unpacked. The next step is to copy (using pkg/conversion) into the
  * internal struct. The runtime package's DefaultScheme has conversion
  * functions installed which will unpack the JSON stored in RawExtension,
  * turning it into the correct object type, and storing it in the Object.
  * (TODO: In the case where the object is of an unknown type, a runtime.Unknown
  * object will be created and stored.)
